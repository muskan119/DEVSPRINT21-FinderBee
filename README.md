The college community is currently overwhelmed by a high volume of emails reporting lost items such as ID cards, calculators, and phones. This influx has led to significant frustration among seniors, who are increasingly irritated by the constant barrage of unnecessary messages.No centralized platform exists for reporting and checking lost items.This results in inefficient communication and difficulty in managing lost and found items. For solving the above problem - We focus on creating a comprehensive Lost and Found website - “FINDERBEE” to streamline the process of reporting, managing, and recovering lost items in college premises This platform facilitates the reporting of lost items by students and enables individuals who find these items to upload relevant details. By centralizing this process, we intend to reduce email clutter and simplify the procedure for students to reclaim their lost belongings.
